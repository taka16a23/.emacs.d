reStructuredText for PEPs
=========================

Original PEP source may be written using two standard formats, a
mildly idiomatic plaintext format and the reStructuredText format
(also, technically plaintext).  These two formats are described in PEP
9 and PEP 12 respectively.  The pep2html.py processing and
installation script knows how to produce the HTML for either PEP
format.

For processing reStructuredText format PEPs, you need the docutils
package, which is available from PyPI.
