Create a Dired buffer that is the union of some existing Dired buffers.
With a non-negative prefix arg, you are prompted for `ls' switches.
With a non-positive prefix arg, you are prompted for file and dir
names to add to the listing - see below.

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.  Any directory names you choose this way are
included as single entries in the listing - the directory contents are
not included (these directories are not unioned).

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.

From Lisp:
 DIRED-NAME is the name of the resulting Dired union buffer.
 DIRBUFS is a list of the names of Dired buffers to union.

 EXTRA is a list of files & directories to be included in the listing.

PREDICATE is a lisp sexp that can refer to the following variables:

    `mode'   [string]  file permission bits, e.g. \"-rw-r--r--\"
    `nlink'  [integer] number of links to file
    `size'   [integer] file size in bytes
    `uid'    [string]  owner
    `gid'    [string]  group (If the gid is not displayed by `ls',
                       this will still be set (to the same as uid))
    `time'   [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    `name'   [string]  the name of the file
    `sym'    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
                       else \"\"
    `inode'  [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)
    `blks'   [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output
                       (ususally in blocks or, with `-k', in Kbytes)
Examples:
  Mark zero-length files: `(equal 0 size)'
  Mark files last modified on Feb 2: `(string-match \"Feb  2\" time)'
  Mark uncompiled Emacs Lisp files (`.el' file without a `.elc' file):

     Then, use \\[dired-mark-sexp] with this sexp:
          (not (file-exists-p (concat name \"c\")))

There's an ambiguity when a single integer not followed by a unit
prefix precedes the file mode: It is then parsed as inode number
and not as block size (this always works for GNU coreutils ls).

Another limitation is that the uid field is needed for the
function to work correctly.  In particular, the field is not
present for some values of `ls-lisp-emulation'.

This function operates only on the buffer content and does not
refer at all to the underlying file system.  Contrast this with

Notes for the developers:
\[1] ELEMENT is a history element which has already been registered in
the `w3m-history-flat' variable.  It is corresponding to URL to be
retrieved at this time, not for the url of the current page.

\[2] SAVE-POS leads this function to save the current emacs-w3m window
configuration; i.e. to run `w3m-history-store-position'.
`w3m-history-store-position' should be called in a w3m-mode buffer, so

Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAP'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level.  See Info node `(elisp)Fringe
     Bitmaps' for more information about fringe bitmaps,
     including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

Define SYMBOL as syntax checker which runs a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

This command installs Jedi server script jediepcserver.py in a

This environment is automatically created by ``virtualenv`` if it
does not exist.

Run this command (i.e., type ``M-x jedi:install-server RET``)
whenever Jedi.el shows a message to do so.  It is a good idea to
run this every time after you update Jedi.el to sync version of
Python modules used by Jedi.el and Jedi.el itself.

You can modify the location of the environment by changing
`jedi:environment-root' and/or `python-environment-directory'.  More
specifically, Jedi.el will install Python modules under the directory
``PYTHON-ENVIRONMENT-DIRECTORY/JEDI:ENVIRONMENT-ROOT``.  Note that you
need command line program ``virtualenv``.  If you have the command in
an unusual location, use `python-environment-virtualenv' to specify the
location.

.. NOTE:: jediepcserver.py is installed in a virtual environment but it
   does not mean Jedi.el cannot recognize the modules in virtual
   environment you are using for your Python development.  Jedi
   EPC server recognize the virtualenv it is in (i.e., the
   environment variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` in your Emacs) and then
   add modules in that environment to its ``sys.path``.  You can
   also add ``--virtual-env PATH/TO/ENV`` to `jedi:server-args'
   to include modules of virtual environment even you launch
   Emacs outside of the virtual environment.

.. NOTE:: It is highly recommended to use this command to install
   Python modules for Jedi.el.  You still can install Python
   modules used by Jedi.el manually.  However, you are then
   responsible for keeping Jedi.el and Python modules compatible.
