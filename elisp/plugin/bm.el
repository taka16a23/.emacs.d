;;; Commentary:

;;; Description:
;;
;;   This package was created because I missed the bookmarks from M$
;;   Visual Studio. They provide an easy way to navigate in a buffer.
;;
;;   bm.el provides visible, buffer local, bookmarks and the ability
;;   to jump forward and backward to the next bookmark.
;;
;;   The use of overlays for bookmarks was inspired by highline.el by
;;   Vinicius Jose Latorre <vinicius@cpqd.com.br>.
;;
;;   This package is developed and testet on GNU Emacs 21.2. It should
;;   also work on XEmacs 21.x
;;
;;   There are some incompabilities with lazy-lock when using
;;   fill-paragraph. All bookmark below the paragraph being filled
;;   will be lost. This issue can be resolved using the jit-lock-mode
;;   introduced in GNU Emacs 21.1
;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;;   To use bm.el, put it in your load-path and add
;;   the following to your .emacs
;;
;;   (require 'bm)
;;
;; or
;;
;;   (autoload 'bm-toggle        "bm" "Toggle bookmark in current buffer." t)
;;   (autoload 'bm-next          "bm" "Goto bookmark."                     t)
;;   (autoload 'bm-previous      "bm" "Goto previous bookmark."            t)
;;


;;; Configuration:
;;
;;   To make it easier to use, assign the commands to some keys.
;;
;;   M$ Visual Studio key setup.
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<C-f2>") 'bm-toggle)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<f2>")   'bm-next)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<S-f2>") 'bm-previous)
;;


;;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; Thanks to Ben Key for XEmacs support.
;; Thanks to Peter Heslin for notifying me on the incompability with
;; lazy-lock.
;; Thanks to Christoph Conrad for adding support for goto line position
;; in bookmarks and simpler wrapping.
;;


;;; Todo:
;;
;;  - Prevent the bookmark (overlay) from being extended when
;;    inserting (before, inside or after) the bookmark in XEmacs. This
;;    is due to the missing support for overlay hooks i XEmacs.
;;


;;; Code:
